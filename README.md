## Description
If you're a foodie or a drink enthusiast, you know how important it is to keep track of the delicious items you've tried. PandaCritic is the perfect app for this, allowing you to easily log and rate the foods and drinks you've experienced. With a sleek and user-friendly interface, you can quickly add details such as photos, descriptions, and ratings, ensuring that you never forget your favorites. Plus, with the ability to search and filter through your reviews, you can easily find the perfect spot for your next meal or drink. Doing this project, we learned how to integrate MySQL and DBeaver into the project and how to deploy on Heroku as well as how to store information in the backend database.

## Description
This is an application that helps the user find and organize their personal critiques so that they can remember where they have been, what foods and drinks they liked, and recommend places to others. This was made to reduce the time spent searching for such places, drinks, and dishes. Doing this project, we learned how to integrate MySQL and DBeaver into the project and how to deploy on Heroku as well as how to store information in the backend database.

## Usage
Access the website:https://shielded-mountain-59854.herokuapp.com/login to login into their account the user need to input their email and password. To sign up for a new account the user need to input their name, email, and create a new password. The user is then redirected to the maps page where they can click on the tabs for bar, restaurant, or boba shop. In the search bar, they can input a city and google maps will show they the locations in that city and a list will appear under the map that will display the locations, ratings, and addresses. When they click on "my review" on the top right of the navigation bar, the user will be redirected to their personal review page, where they can store the name, rating, description, and the restaurant name of any order the user has had. There is a log out button on the top navigation bar as well as a download button that will direct the user to the github repository for this project.
